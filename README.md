### What I learned

This was a great challenge with lots of little css tricks. It was fun trying to build the phone screen as I've never had to do that before. The hardest part was getting it all to be responsive so it scales up and down at the same rate.

I used `clamp()` for the first time and it's a good way of controlling the min and max restrictions of an element.

I changed some of the colours slightly to make sure they meet the WCAG contrast requirements.

I was able to complete the bonus challenge of having the screen load progressively upon opening the window, as well as adding a couple of little easter eggs and a nice floating animation on the phone container.
